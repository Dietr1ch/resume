#+title: Résumé

* Info
This is a LaTeX project based on [[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/recreating-business-insiders-cv-of-marissa-mayer/gtqfpbwncfvp][LianTze Lim's AltaCV template]].

* Build
I'm using Nix to set up the environment (See [[./shell.nix]]), but GNUMake to build
it as I don't want to clutter my local nix store with all my temporary builds.

#+begin_src fish
  make
#+end_src

* Changes
** AltaCV
The original function to highlight publication names didn't work for me in
XeLaTeX, so I simplified it to simply match on surnames as delimiters seemed
inconsistent after debugging with ~\wlog{}~.
